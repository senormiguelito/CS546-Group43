# NOTE on codes

1. Error code 400 implies a bad request (by the user)
2. Error code 403 implies user is unauthorized to reach the page they are trying to (not logged in/registered)
3. Error code 404 implies not found
4. Error code 500 is a server error
Lets keep error codes consistent and correct


Update 5/4:
(Mikey): I did a lot of work for projects. It is tricky because it is a subdocument of users, and also because it is attached to 2 user objects simultaneously. So any creation/removal needs to apply to both users involved.
So I implemented a wide permutation of functions (getProjectByProjectId, getProjectByUserId, getBothUsersByProject, getUserByProject, remove, and update) to account for all the functionality we might need

If someone who feels comfortable with 'update'/ HTTP 'PUT' can double/triple check that it is implemented correctly, that would be legendary.
(also please double check on all my shit)

Still for me:
routes for reviews/ratings
clientside verification for reviews/ratings
clientside for projects
views for reviews/ratings
views for projects
middleware for all the above

-------------------------------
Home/posts:

"Want to get something done?" --> rename to "create a post!"
* once post is created, click on to go to post page. Should have more notable way to contact

- the contact link at the bottom doesnt work
- ability to post comment isn't working, creates a "Page Not Found" error, which shouldn't happen and isn't the right error regardless
- on the posts page, clicking on the post leads to "Page Not Found"

"want a job?" links to /post/createJob --> "Page Not Found" with the following error: "error : Error: This id is not a valid ObjectId"

Error upon creating a post with 3 categories "error : Error: Update: each category must be a non-empty string"

link to "See All Providers" (both at top and bottom) is not working, again to "Page Not Found"
- need to get rid of unnecessary duplicate

link at bottom to "Sign Up" not working --> "Page Not Found"

-------------------------------
Job Providers:
link works correctly
- Display/format is funky af but thats not a painful fix
"View" link does not work --> "Page Not Found"
"Back" link is working

-------------------------------
Job Seekers:
Link is not working: "Page Not Found"

-------------------------------
My Profile:
link to get to is fine.
Edit is not yet a link, so we need to change that so we can see how the 'edit' functionality is

-------------------------------
My Posts:
Link does not work --> "Page Not Found"

-------------------------------
Messages:
Empty page, need to make work on this IMMEDIATELY because there is a lot of testing and checking to do





Update 5/2

1. In our proposal we listed contct and direct messages separately, so to implement contact we can just make a button that reveals all contact info.
(obviously only viewable if logged in)

2. Still need to implement project creation. Tricky logic, easy once figured out.
  So once people react to each other's posts/interact, they can agree to create a project.
  Projects are necessary to create a review, because the review object will have to refer the id of the project being reviewed
  Projects = subdocument of both users involved

3. Posts needs to be cleaned up:
  create helper functions for each input and/or function and implement those into the code


4. Routes, client side js, middleware!!!

5. Cam we modify the sign up so once they are signed up, it logs them in with that info


## Login/Signup:
Once register/login form is submitted, it takes a long time to load... is there a way to improve that?
For log out: add confirmation message after clicking 'Logout' to confirm to the user that they have been logged out

## Profile:
'Edit' button is not routing

## Messages:
'Messages' page shows blank (assuming currently because there are none..) lets add option to create a message
- by pasting in a userID? Or if that's impractical, by email.
- call getby(email) function, see if it makes sense to have that call the get by id function once you extract the id from the email that corresponds to that user object 

## data/users.js
Do we want to throw errors if there are no users found when calling getBy() or just return something empty?
--> return empty () and display a message "No users found when filtering by X"

## data/posts.js
Helper functions are implemented, its cleaned up. Rushiraj, check thru and make sure all objects are returning as you want them to
** need to check on what we want to do with images **

## Unauthorized access (403):
If a user types in a specific url (which does correspond to an existing route), lets make the message that appears correspond to the page they tried to access and that they must be logged in to access it

If a user types in an invalid (nonexisting route) url --> ERROR 404 NOT FOUND --> hide the toolbar/contents of the website just like login/signup 

## My posts

## Mikey sux:
I suck at coding

SOMEONE PLEASE CHECK OVER THE PROJECTS ROUTES

## AJAX:
Need at least 1 ajax form submission




## (tota11y accessibility shit ....for much, much later on)
can't forget about because there is a lot of points to be lost for this


## input sanitization
Need to defend against XSS attacks with inputs

mongo makes it very easy to use geolocation to filter results based on the area.
Come see him he'll show you his snippet from back when using it.

## random errors: 
1. Deleting comments is showing error and redriectingf to a different page.
