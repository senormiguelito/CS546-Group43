Helper functions implementing for /posts functions error checking
Do we want reviews to push into user object?



Update 5/2

1. In our proposal we listed contct and direct messages separately, so to implement contact we can just make a button that reveals all contact info.
(obviously only viewable if logged in)

2. Still need to implement project creation. Tricky logic, easy once figured out.
  So once people react to each other's posts/interact, they can agree to create a project.
  Projects are necessary to create a review, because the review object will have to refer the id of the project being reviewed
  Projects = subdocument of both users involved

3. Posts needs to be cleaned up:
  create helper functions for each input and/or function and implement those into the code


4. Routes, client side js, middleware!!!
